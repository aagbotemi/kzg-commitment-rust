# KZG Polynomial Commitment
KZG (Kate, Zaverucha, and Goldfeder) polynomial commitment is a cryptographic technique used for efficiently proving and verifying polynomial evaluations. It provides a way to commit to a polynomial such that later, one can prove specific evaluations of the polynomial at chosen points without revealing the entire polynomial.
The KZG polynomial commitment scheme consists of four steps:
- Setup
- Committing to a Polynomial
- Prove
- Verify
